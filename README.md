# 🚀 Holberton Dart Project

This project was developed as part of my training at **Holberton School Uruguay**.  
The goal was to practice **Dart** as a programming language, covering logic, data structures, and building applications.

## 📌 Description

The project includes the development of a **Dart application** with the following features:

- ✅ Problem-solving and logic exercises  
- ✅ Console scripts (CLI tools) for automation

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in **structured programming, package management, and basic software architecture**.
